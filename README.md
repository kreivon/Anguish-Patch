# Anguish Patch - Minecraft Resource Pack
This is a resource pack I use personally while playing Minecraft.  Various tweaks are present but the bulk of the pack utilizes custom item textures (CIT) to reskin items based on name or other attributes.  This means in order to function as intended you will need to download [CITResewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) or another mod that provides this feature.

### Disabling Fairy Bottle Sounds
This resource pack overrides the default sounds for the totem of undying.  In order to disable this feature, rename `assets/minecraft/sounds.json` to `assets/minecraft/sounds.json.disabled` and it should be back to normal.
